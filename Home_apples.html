<h1>Our founder</h1>
<p> Our founder was a man named Aric Minnich, he had an absolute obsession with apple juice and apple cider, so much so that it drove him to the brink of insanity.
    He would spend days looking at pictures of apple juice and apple cider. He would always be asking the local orchard owners if he could admire their apples.
    Soon through lots of determination, he soon decided to start his orchard, slowly making the orchard he realized that taking care of an orchard and managing the product is a handful so he decided to dedicate himself to juice.
    It is said while drinking apple juice, he came up with the idea to make a company based entirely on apple products, instead of having to care for an orchard they could pour all their resources inside of production and get the apples else where.
    So today we stand all thanks to the obsession and efforts of a man who loved apple juice more than life itself.

<h1>Our future </h1>
<p> While we started simply with apple juice we have decided to keep expanding onwards, as of right now we now offer apple cider
    However, we do not plan on stopping at just apple liquids for the field of apple production is becoming much more interesting in our field as new developments for recipes have come along.
    to start there is now apple sauce which is where you crush up apples and add seasonings to it, we are hoping to release it soon but trying to get the seasoning right is not very easy. 
    We are hoping to soon come out with candy apples, popular with the kids these candy apples are apples that have been impaled by a stick and dipped in caramel with toppings on it. 
    However new recipes are not the only thing as we are discovering new apples as well to stay competitive. All of this makes our future much more interesting and flavorful.
