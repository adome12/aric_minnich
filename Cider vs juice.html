    <h1 style="position: relative;left:350px;color:rgb(190, 144, 8)">What is the difference between apple juice and apple cider?</h1>
    <h2 class="leftheader">Apple Juice</h2>
    <pre>
    <h2 class="rightheader">Apple Cider</h2>
    </pre>
    <p class="leftalign">Apple Juice is non-seasonal meaning that it is available during all times of the year, 
        also it has a much different color for it is crisper, it is more filtered and pasteurized and it is non-alcoholic, 
        apple juice is also very good for you as it contains many fantastic antioxidants, which these help prevent cell damage
        which is very good for everybody. It is also a great source of hydration considering it is 88% water. 
        While it is still 88% water it still tastes amazing and apple juice pairs well with a lot of foods.

    </p>
    <p class="rightalign">However, apple cider is less pasteurized and also less processed but it also has a lot of benefits that apple juice does not. 
    Apple cider contains polyphenols, which are compounds in plants that act as antioxidants.
     They can help the body to fight against free radicals and cell damage, lowering your risk of certain types of cancer, diabetes, and heart disease.
      Polyphenols also help to ease inflammation in the body. Lower chance of cardiovascular disease. 
    The phytonutrients in apple cider can help to stop the oxidation process of bad cholesterol, which leads to the buildup of plaque in your arteries. That plaque increases your risk for heart disease. </p>
